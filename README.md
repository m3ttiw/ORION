# ORION
ORION: Omniscient Response and Interaction OperatioN. "Orion" refers to a prominent constellation, symbolizing strength and guidance.
This project aim to produce my personal ai assistant for everyday task

## Some features:
- voice interacion: user can interact with ORION using a microphone
- display logging: ORION displays the prompt and the response on the console
- human-like voice response
- humor level: user can set the humor level of ORION responses (like TARS in interstellar)
- humbling when searching (humm... let me see...) and generating (well.., in short terms...) the response


## Some ideas:
- ORION could "call" other assistants for feature specific task (like NOVA(Navigational Organizer and Virtual Assistant) for navigation, ZEUS(Zero-latency Electronic User Support) for something else...)
